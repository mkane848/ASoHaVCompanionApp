# Handoff

Status snapshot and open threads for whoever (human or Claude) picks this project up next. If
you're starting new work here, read this first — especially "Open issues" below, so you don't
duplicate a fix or lose track of something already in flight.

Last updated: 2026-08-02, end of the session that took the app from `0.1.0` (SQLite +
hand-rolled auth, local-only) to `0.3.0` (Supabase-backed, deployed live). See
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the version-by-version detail and
[README.md](README.md#architecture-notes--judgment-calls) for design decisions and rationale.

## Current state

- **Live at:** https://asohav.onrender.com (Render, single Web Service — see
  [README.md#deployment](README.md#deployment)). Login confirmed working as of this writing.
- **Version:** `0.3.0` (all four `package.json` files, synchronized — see CHANGELOG.md).
- **Database:** live Supabase project (`ihrtdbknhpgysgwaqnfj`), all 5 migrations applied,
  security advisor clean.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is green on `main`.

## Open issues

Ordered roughly by how much they matter.

### 1. Unresolved: "loading error" reported after login on the live deployment

The repo owner logged into the live deployment and reported hitting "some sort of load error when
trying to access resources," alongside a layout bug. **The layout bug was found and fixed**
(PR #9 — `AdminNav`/`AdminListPane` wouldn't shrink below ~490px combined, so the Content Admin
panel's panes wrapped onto separate rows instead of staying side-by-side on a phone-width screen).

**The load error was never diagnosed.** The development sandbox this work was done in has no
network path to either the live Render URL or the Supabase project directly (confirmed via
repeated `403`s from the sandbox's egress proxy — see "Sandbox network constraints" below), so it
couldn't be reproduced with real browser tooling. We never got specifics from the repo owner
(exact error text, which screen/action triggers it, console/network output) before the session
ended. **Next step:** get the exact error message and which screen/action triggers it — ideally a
screenshot of the error itself, or the browser console + Network tab output on desktop where dev
tools are available — then reproduce and fix.

### 2. Bond handshake row-locking (PR #5) is merged but never runtime-verified

`withBondLock()` (`apps/server/src/repo.ts`) opens a direct `pg` connection and runs
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside a transaction for propose/accept/reject. The logic was written and
reviewed carefully, and the *build* was verified end-to-end locally, but the actual live
transaction/locking behavior against Supabase's Postgres was never smoke-tested — same sandbox
networking blocker as above. Worth a real test once someone has network access to the live app:
in particular, two concurrent requests against the same Bond (e.g. two accepts, or an
accept + reject race) should serialize correctly rather than one silently overwriting the other.

### 3. `v0.3.0` git tag exists locally only — never pushed

Per the versioning policy in CHANGELOG.md ("tag the merge commit vX.Y.Z"), a `v0.3.0` annotated
tag was created locally on the PR #8 merge commit. Pushing it failed with a `403` — this
session's git credentials were scoped to push the `main-2coxec` branch only, not arbitrary refs
like tags. Someone with full push access needs to run:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git tag -a v0.3.0 bb91dba23252d5ec27427f1991a8822676703199 -m "v0.3.0"
git push origin v0.3.0
```

(`bb91dba` is the PR #8 merge commit — where the `0.3.0` CHANGELOG entry landed.) Future releases
should keep tagging their merge commit; check `git tag -l` isn't falling behind `CHANGELOG.md`
again.

### 4. Commits from this session are unsigned

The container's commit-signing key was empty/misconfigured partway through the session. The repo
owner explicitly authorized pushing unsigned commits to keep moving ("we'll figure out git auth
issue after we finish the work plan") — but the underlying signing setup itself was never fixed.
GitHub shows these commits as "Unverified." Worth sorting out the signing key/environment config
if verified commits matter going forward.

### 5. Sandbox network constraints (context for future sessions, not a bug to fix)

The Claude Code environment this work was done in has a locked-down egress policy: outbound HTTPS
only reaches a small allowlist (GitHub, npm registry, Anthropic, a few others), and raw TCP
(anything that isn't proxied HTTP/HTTPS) is blocked entirely. Confirmed concretely during this
session:

- Direct `pg` connections to Supabase (both the IPv6-only direct-connection hostname *and* the
  IPv4 pooler) hang/fail — raw Postgres wire protocol isn't proxied HTTP.
- Plain `curl`/browser (Playwright) requests to `asohav.onrender.com` and to
  `ihrtdbknhpgysgwaqnfj.supabase.co` both get a `403` from the sandbox's own proxy — these hosts
  simply aren't on the allowlist.
- The Supabase MCP tool still works fine for schema/migration/query work, since that tool runs
  outside this sandbox's network entirely.

Net effect: **this kind of environment cannot do live browser QA or live database smoke-testing of
this app.** A future session working on "does X actually work" tasks either needs a different
environment/network policy, or needs the repo owner to run it themselves and relay results
(console errors, screenshots, network tab, `psql` output, etc.).

### 6. Render MCP connector never worked in this session

The repo owner tried connecting Render's official MCP connector (for driving deploys/env vars
directly) but hit a "failed to connect MCP" error, and a later attempt showed it installed at the
account level but not enabled for the chat. Deployment was done manually instead: writing
`render.yaml` as a Blueprint and having the repo owner paste env vars into Render's dashboard by
hand. If the connector gets working in a future session, Render changes could go through it
directly instead of this git-based Blueprint flow (though `render.yaml` should stay either way —
it's the actual source of truth Render reads).

## Everything else

- What's deliberately *not* built (combat, dice rolling, Bond-proposal expiry, etc.) is listed in
  [README.md#whats-not-built](README.md#whats-not-built) — those are scoped out by the original
  design handoff, not gaps from this work.
- Design decisions and judgment calls (why Realtime instead of WebSockets, why no
  character-creation flow, etc.) are in
  [README.md#architecture-notes--judgment-calls](README.md#architecture-notes--judgment-calls).
- Full version-by-version history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
